# KingWear

/// Welcome to KingWear \\\

My hopes and dreams for this app were to have collections of shoes displayed on the page categorized by brand, style, and gender. I learned so much about crafting a full-stack application from scratch and that has definitely has helped build my confidence in my ability as a developer. This app is going to eventually be able to allow users to personalize their accounts with previous search history, likes, and viewed shoes so that what the user sees is everything they personally love about shoes. Instead of consuming everything the app wants you to see, the app will learn your interests over time and filter your shoe tastes straight to you. 


/// What I ended up with \\\

Although I had high hopes for this app, so far, a user can siugn up and log in, however, sessions cannot be saved or remembered, and authentication isn't fully functional, so there's no way to check if a remembered password is incoorect. A user can search for a certain shoe through google's search api, but the flaw with this is that the user to search for literally anything because it is basically just Google.
